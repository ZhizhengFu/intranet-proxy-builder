# intranet-proxy-builder

> warning: on building now.

This repository is a script to build a proxy server for the intranet. It is based on the [pages](https://charlesfrazier.github.io/tech/proxy.html) I wrote on my website.

If you donnot want to read the pages, you can just run the script. It will build a proxy server for you.
